        KNN classifier

# Import the necessary libraries
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Create the data
X = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]]
y = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create the KNN classifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

# Fit the classifier to the training data
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Print the accuracy
print(accuracy)
